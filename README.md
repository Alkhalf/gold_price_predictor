# Gold_price_predictor

## Prediction Problem
In this project we aim to predict the gold price for cuurent hour. When we say the gold price we mean the close price for the current hour. The prediction will be based on different features such as the inflation rate, volume and all of features  will be realated to the previous hour.
## Pipelines

In this project we made four pippelines in order to conduct and implment the project. 
### Backfill 
In the backfill file we request the data from the Binanc API. Firstly we connect to the API. Then we request data for gold hourly prices for the last year. This data contains features such as timestamp, open high, low close, and volume. Then we save these data in CSV files. However, for the gold we use the PAX asset which completely represents the gold price, and for the currency, we use USDT, which also has the USD as a base. Another feature that we also collected is the EURUSDT. This feature represents if the USDT changes prices in comparison to the euro. We thought also of having a feature BTCUSDT, but we found there is no strong correlation between the bitcoin and the PAX prices. Same for bitcoin and USDT. The reason is both USDT and PAX have a physical asset as a base and therefore  both are stable in price-changing terms. Finally, in this file, we save the features on the Hopswerk so we can extract these features later.

### Training

In our traing we retrieve the data the historic data from hopworks and selctioed and appropriate features to train out model. To train our model we used XGBoost Regressor and we splited the data into traingn and test data. We also stored the model into hopwrks to reuse for the predcitios in the inferece pipline 

### Inference 

In this pipline what we do is just predict the gold price for the current hour. We start by retreive the data and the mode√∂ from hopworks and then predcit the gold price. We repesent the predction as plot and save it in the docs 

## Results

The evaluation of our model was based on the prediction of the test data. The test error (MSE) was The 43.1


Here we can see one plot that present the predction of gold price in 17:00

## Reflection and Discussion

In this project we tried to automate the adding of new features into Hopworks and the inference and prediction of the new add data. However we was not able to run the gihtub action.. The reason is that we use Binaca API in the features.ipynb and when the Github actions run this we get an error that indicate "restricted location". Thefore we run htese files locally and one several times and one see the result in the docs. Evey plot repreent a prediction for a new hour , while csv file cotain the new added Into hopwors. 


The model seem to perform well and the resons is that data of the previous hour  and currect hour is related  and when pass all features of the prevois hour then it will  predict the gold price. Howerver , it interssting to test other models and see if we get noticable diffeerecnes in the performance.   

In feature , one could add new data to train the model, becuase  we used only data for last 365 days. More data will give more generalization power to the model to predcit the gold price.
