# Gold_price_predictor

## Prediction Problem
In this project we aim to predict the gold price for cuurent hour. When we say the gold price we mean the close price for the current hour. The prediction will be based on different features such as the inflation rate, volume and all of features  will be realated to the previous hour.
## Pipelines

In this project we made four pippelines in order to conduct and implment the project.

## Reflection and Discussion

In this project we tried to automate the adding of new features into Hopworks and the inference and prediction of the new add data. However we was not able to run the gihtub action.. The reason is that we use Binaca API in the features.ipynb and when the Github actions run this we get an error that indicate "restricted location". Thefore we run htese files locally and one several times and one see the result in the docs. Evey plot repreent a prediction for a new hour , while csv file cotain the new added Into hopwors. 


The model seem to perform well and the resons is that data of the previous hour  and currect hour is related  and when pass all features of the prevois hour then it will  predict the gold price. Howerver , it interssting to test other models and see if we get noticable diffeerecnes in the performance.
